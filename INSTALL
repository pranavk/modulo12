# Requirements

You need to have following libraries/softwares to successfully build and run
this project :

*    g++     	     - GNU C++ compiler to compile the project
*    SystemC library - to compile the project
*    gtkwave 	     - to analyse the waveforms

# Running the Modulo 12 counter 

This modulo 12 counter can be easily made to run by following some very simple
steps. In the beginning you just need to follow the following sequence of
commands to start.

- make

This `make` will automatically compile all necessary files, link them and create
the executable with name `modulo12.vcd`.

- ./modulo12

Running the executable modulo12 will create a vcd file with name
'modulo12.vcd'. To open that file you need to have gtkwave installed on your
system. 

# Additional Notes 

The project is imported into a very famous Version Control System, `git`. You
can view the history showing the development phase of the project and take
various other advantages that git offers to a project.
